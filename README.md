# FIFA-23-Viz-with-Plotly
This project makes use of the  Plotly package to analyze data on football(soccer) players socured from EA Sport's FIFA 2023 via Kaggle

Visualisations have always been an integral part of the Data Science process due to their ability to tell compelling stories and stoke users' imaginations. Proper use of visualizations also provides a better perspective and proper context for data users which enables them to spot trends and helps in making vital decisions in a faster manner.

Python has an array of visualization packages such as; Matplolib, Seaborn, Plotly, GGplot, Altair, Bokeh, to mention a few. The plotly package was picked because of its interactive nature which allows for better storytelling, and better aesthetics when compared to Matplotlib and Seaborn, a wide range of statistical/scientific/ geographic charts and lastly its flexibility. Various graphs from this library are going to be used in illustrating the dataset. Also, a couple of pandas methods will be used to manipulate the dataset in order to present quality graphs.
